# Web engineering project 
Made with MERN for full stack development. <br/>
The backend uses a database hosted online by MongoDB which may be taken offline due to inactivity (it should stay online until May 2023).

## Instructions 
The web app can be run by navigating inside the folder called "mern" and calling "docker-compose up" and then going to "http://localhost:3000" in the browser. Make sure that Docker is running already before calling the command.

The ports for the server and the client can be changed in the .env file.
